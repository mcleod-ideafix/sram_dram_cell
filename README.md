# Model for a SRAM and a DRAM memory cell.
A (very) simplified schematic for a SRAM and a DRAM memory cell. Made just for didactic purposes. Project made using EasyEDA, ready for JLCPCB.
Each memory cell has two push buttons, for storing 1 or 0. In a SRAM cell, pressing one of them is enough for the cell to store the value. On the other hand, in a DRAM cell, you have to press the push button from time to time to "refresh" the value that is actually stored in a capacitor.
